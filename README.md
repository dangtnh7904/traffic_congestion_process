# üö¶ Traffic Congestion Process

**Real-time traffic data pipeline powering a smart map app with congestion visualization and optimal route prediction.**  
Built on **Apache Spark** for scalable ETL and analytics.

---

## üìò Overview

`traffic_congestion_process` is a real-time data processing system that collects, cleans, and analyzes live traffic data from multiple sources.  
It enables **real-time congestion visualization**, **trend analysis**, and **optimal route prediction** for intelligent transportation systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Pipeline Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Streams live data from APIs, sensors, and GPS feeds.
   - Uses **Kafka** or socket streaming for real-time event ingestion.

2. **ETL (Extract ‚Äì Transform ‚Äì Load)**
   - Powered by **Apache Spark Streaming** for distributed, fault-tolerant processing.
   - Performs data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

3. **Analytics & Prediction**
   - Uses **Spark MLlib** for congestion prediction and speed estimation.
   - Computes optimal routes based on live and historical data.

4. **Storage & Visualization**
   - Stores processed traffic data in **HDFS**, **Cassandra**, or **PostgreSQL**.
   - Feeds results to a **smart map frontend** (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox, React).
